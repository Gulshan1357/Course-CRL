# Course-CRL (Conquering Responsive Layouts)

This is my solution to the final challenge of course. The free course was created by Kevin Powell: https://courses.kevinpowell.co.


A very simple wep page, I build, so as to practice writing clean code.

**KeyPoints:**
1. Working with responsive units (Mobile-first Approach)
2. Flexbox
3. Media Queries
